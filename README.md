# face-detectipn-ai
Face Detection AI is a robust, lightweight, and scalable application for detecting human faces in images or video streams. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and pre-trained models like Haar cascades, Dlib, or modern deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV.
